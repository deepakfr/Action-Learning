# Movie_Reccommendation_System
**Project Description:** The aim of this project is to develop a recommendation engine for movies that can suggest personalized movie recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences. The recommendation engine will be developed using machine learning algorithms and natural language processingtechniques. The project will involve collecting and preprocessing movie data, analyzing user behavior and preferences, developing and evaluation recommendation algorithms, and deploying the recommendation engine on a suitable platform.Overall, the project will provide valuable experience in developing machine learning-based recommenda5on systems, data analysis, and system deployment.

**Objectives:**
The primary objective of the recommendation engine is to provide personalized movie recommenda5ons to users based on their viewing history and preferences. The recommendations should be relevant, diverse, and reflective of the user's interests.
